# Name:         netcdf_builder
# Purpose:      Selection of functions to open, create and manage netCDF
#       objects and files. These routines have been developed and tested with
#       netCDF3 and netCDF4 file formats.

#
# Updates:
# 24 Mar 2011   Initial demonstration of the idea.
# 16 Nov 2011   Separated the code into logical components and made the netCDF
#       object the primary object to be passed between routines.
#       Generalised the nc3_add_data() routine to accept slices (or slice-like
#       elements) and thus give the user more control over where data is placed
#       in the netCDF variable.
# 22 Nov 2011   Added optional timeunit argument to nc3_set_timelatlon().
#       Some minor changes to the comments.
# 10 Feb 2013   Renamed to netcdf_builder.py.
#       Changed the 'nc3' prefix of all routines to 'nc'.  Retained 'nc3*'
#       function names for backward compatibility.
#       Refreshed routines to work with the netCDF4-python package.
#       Updated add variables commands to add a _FillValue by default.
#       Added mode keyword in call to Dataset for permission parameter
#       in nc_open.
#       Added zlib option to nc_set_var.
# 11 Apr 2013   Added chunksizes option to nc_set_var.
# 17 Apr 2013   Wrapped import of OrderedDict in a try statement.
#       Rearranged default order of dimension attributes.
#       Added a check for changing the _FillValue attribute of a variable in
#       nc_set_attributes.
# 12 Oct 2013   Added axis attribute to time, latitude and longitude dimensions
#       in nc_set_timelatlon (not strictly required but handy for
#       completeness).
#       Removed 'nc_' prefix from each function name but retained previous
#       function names as alias functions at the bottom of thescript.
#       Changed default format to NETCDF4_CLASSIC in ncopen().
# 19 Mar 2014   Added add_bounds() function for adding the CF bounds attribute
#       to a dimension and the associated bounds array to a new variable.
#       Added warning comment to add_data() docstring.
# 15 Aug 2014   Added type normalisation to get_attributes - now as an
#       internal function called for all global and variable attributes and
#       switchable via a boolean parameter. Previously, variable attributes
#       were normalised.
# 12 May 2015   Added _ncversion() and _setattr() functions to provide a
#       wrapper for the bug described at
#         https://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/issues/detail?id=110
#       A warning message is printed about the bug if the netCDF C library
#       version is < 4.2 and an AttributeError occured when setting the
#       attribute value.  The AttributeError is then raised.
#       The library bug may not be cause of the error but if it is then the
#       message should prove helpful.
# 13 May 2015   Implemented the work-around, in addition to printing the
#       warning message.
# 17 Nov 2015   Changed licence for this implementation to Apache 2.0 to align
#       with AGDC-v2 collaboration requirements. Updated copyright year to 2015.
#       Removed tabs from the header section, towards PEP8.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# All functions, except ncopen(), operate on the netCDF object that is
# returned from ncopen().  The functions contain "standard" operations for
# creating a netCDF file, defining dimensions, adding data and adding/removing
# metadata.  If additional operations are required then the netCDF4 package
# routines can be used directly.  In which case, the functions here can be
# considered as examples of using the netCDF4 package routines.
#
# One limitation on returning the netCDF object from ncopen() is that the
# corresponding filename is not retained with the object.  If the filename was
# added as an object attribute it would become a global attribute in the
# resulting file.  Other possible work-arounds, such as managing a filename
# object attribute separately or creating a class that inherits from the
# netCDF object class, would create a non-standard netCDF implementation.
# So it is instead left to the user to retain and manage the filename.
#
# The netCDF4 package uses NumPy arrays and data types to manage data.  As
# such it is difficult to exclude NumPy entirely when working with the
# netCDF4 package.  If NumPy is not available on your system then you *may*
# be able to use this code as a guide and customise your own routines.
#
# Requires:
#  NumPy
#  OrderedDict

    Add variable data to the given variable name.
    Data can be a list, tuple or NumPy array.

    In general, the size and shape of data must correspond to the size and
    shape of the variable, except when:
    - There are dimension(s) of size 1 defined for the variable, in which
      case these dimension(s) don't need to be included in data.
    - There are unlimited dimension(s) defined for the variable, in which
      case these dimension(s) of the data can be of any size.

    It is also possible to add data to a subset of the variable via slices
    (ranges and strides) passed in through the index parameter.  The only
    caveat to using this feature is that the size and shape suggested by index
    must match the size and shape of data and follow the "In general..." rules
    for the variable as given above.
    This is potentially a very complicated feature.  The netCDF module
    (netCDF4.Variable) will fail if the variable and data dimensions and
    index slices are not compatible.  It is difficult to catch or manipulate
    the inputs to satisfy the netCDF module due to the variety and flexibility
    of this feature.  Experimentation before production is highly recommended.

    Index is a sequence (list,tuple) of slice objects, lists, tuples, integers
    and/or strings.  Each element of the sequence is internally converted to a
    slice object.
    For best results, a sequence of slice objects is recommended so that you
    have explicit control over where the data is placed within the variable.
    The other element types are provided for convenience.

    A slice(None,None,None) object is equivalent to filling the variable with
    the data along the corresponding dimension.  Thus, the default behaviour
    (with index not given) is to fill the variable with data.

    Integers are taken to be the start index.  The end index is then chosen to
    match the data array.  This feature only works if the number of data
    dimensions matches the number of variable dimensions.  Otherwise its too
    hard to guess which data dimension the index integer refers to.
    If an integer element is provided in index, a ValueError will be raised if
    the number of data and variable dimensions do not match.

    Strings are probably only really useful for testing.  Strings are of the
    form "start:stop:stride" with any missing element chosen to be None, i.e.:
      '' or ':' -> slice(None,None,None)
      '2' or '2:' -> slice(2,None,None)
      ':2' -> slice(None,2,None)
      '::2' -> slice(None,None,2)
      '2:4' -> slice(2,4,None)
